# Cloud-Bursting-HPC

Project Details: For the HPC Cloud Bursting project, our plan involves configuring Slurm HPC
clusters using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with GCP's specialized HPC toolkits. Simultaneously, we'll
set up a Slurm Cluster on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using ParallelCluster. Our primary focus will be
on efficiently executing Bursting jobs from our on-premises Greene cluster to both GCP and AWS
environments. To streamline data management, we aim to leverage workflow management tools like
Snakemake to facilitate seamless data transfer to designated locations. Furthermore, we intend to explore
the potential of AWS Batch and GCP Batch for managing batch jobs in this context


Platforms/ Technologies: Cloud, containers and workflow management tools
